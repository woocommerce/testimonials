== Usage ==

To display your testimonials via a theme or a custom plugin, please use the following code:

`<?php do_action( 'woothemes_testimonials' ); ?>`

To add arguments to this, please use any of the following arguments, using the syntax provided below:

* 'limit' => 5 (the maximum number of items to display)
* 'per_row' => 3 (when creating rows, how many items display in a single row?)
* 'orderby' => 'menu_order' (how to order the items - accepts all default WordPress ordering options)
* 'order' => 'DESC' (the order direction)
* 'id' => 0 (display a specific item)
* 'display_author' => true (whether or not to display the author information)
* 'display_avatar' => true (whether or not to display the author avatar)
* 'display_url' => true (whether or not to display the URL information)
* 'echo' => true (whether to display or return the data - useful with the template tag)
* 'size' => 50 (the pixel dimensions of the image)
* 'title' => '' (an optional title)
* 'before' => '&lt;div class="widget widget_woothemes_testimonials"&gt;' (the starting HTML, wrapping the testimonials)
* 'after' => '&lt;/div&gt;' (the ending HTML, wrapping the testimonials)
* 'before_title' => '&lt;h2&gt;' (the starting HTML, wrapping the title)
* 'after_title' => '&lt;/h2&gt;' (the ending HTML, wrapping the title)
* 'category' => 0 (the ID/slug of the category to filter by)

The various options for the "orderby" parameter are:

* 'none'
* 'ID'
* 'title'
* 'date'
* 'menu_order'

`<?php do_action( 'woothemes_testimonials', array( 'limit' => 10, 'display_author' => false ) ); ?>`

The same arguments apply to the shortcode which is `[woothemes_testimonials]` and the template tag, which is `<?php woothemes_testimonials(); ?>`.

== Usage Examples ==

Adjusting the limit and image dimension, using the arguments in the three possible methods:

do_action() call:

`<?php woothemes_testimonials( array( 'limit' => 10, 'size' => 100 ) ); ?>`
